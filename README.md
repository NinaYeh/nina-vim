# Nina's Vim

My vim setting and using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my vim.

I used [eddie-vim2](https://github.com/kaochenlong/eddie-vim2) for several months to practice vim and after a while, my colleagues teach me how to use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my own setting.

That's it. (*´∀`)~♥
hug, Nina
